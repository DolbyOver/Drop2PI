{"name":"Drop2pi","tagline":"This is a simple Dropbox Client tool to sync files to Raspberry PI.","body":"## IMPORTANT ##\r\n\r\nwatchdog is needed in this lib, but a [bug](https://github.com/GuoJing/Drop2PI/issues/5) was found in latest watchdog (2014.1.29 version 0.7.0), in Mac OS, if you replace a file in `Finder`, it will cause two events, first one is delete, then another one is create, so in drop to pi, this will delete file in server if you replace file in `Finder`. Command in command line like `mv` and `cp` will NOT have this problem.\r\n\r\nSo I download the watchdog to the code and add filter in fsevents.py. If you don't need it, ignore this.\r\n\r\nIf this really matter to you, please install [watchdog](https://github.com/GuoJing/watchdog) here.\r\n\r\n## Drop2PI ##\r\n\r\nSorry for bad English.\r\n\r\nThis is a very simple tool to sync files between Dropbox and Raspberry PI. In fact this command tools can used any system running on Python.\r\n\r\nBut I only wants to sync files to Raspberry PI. So I called this Dropbox to PI.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Overall ##\r\n\r\n1. download the file and folder auto.\r\n2. modify the folder, auto sync to Dropbox.\r\n3. delete the file or folder which deleted in Dropbox server auto.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Install ##\r\n\r\nYou can install by download the source or\r\n\r\n\tpython setup.py install\r\n\t\r\nor\r\n\r\n\tpip install d2pi\r\n\r\n## V 0.0.5 ##\r\n\r\n1. make it OO\r\n2. replace print to logging\r\n\r\n## V 0.0.4 ##\r\n\r\n1. set config at ~/.d2pi/config.yml\r\n2. new dropbox auth method (flow)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Need to do ##\r\n\r\n1. config the max donload file size.\r\n2. if there is syncing event, quit update event. (see known bug)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Packages ##\r\n\r\nYou have to install [Watchdog](https://github.com/gorakhargosh/watchdog) first.\r\n\r\n\tsudo pip install watchdog\r\n\r\nAnd also download Dropbox python SDK [HERE](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/sdk).\r\n\r\n\tpip install dropbox\r\n\r\nAnd yaml.\r\n\r\n## Setup ##\r\n\r\n\r\n#### init ####\r\n\r\n\tpython auth.py \r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n\tfrom d2pi import auth\r\n\tauth.auth()\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have to go to [Dropbox Develop Page](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps) to create a App.\r\n\r\nAfter created a App, you can find the APP_KEY and APP_SECRET, ACCESS_TYPE is also needed.\r\n\r\nyou can edit your config file at `~/.d2pi/config.yml`, path_to_watch is the dir you want to watch.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### run watching.py ####\r\n\r\n\tpython watching.py\r\n\t\r\nor\r\n\r\n\tfrom d2pi import watch\r\n\twatcher = watch.Watcher()\r\n\twatcher.run()\r\n\r\nThis will watch dir `PATH_TO_WATCH`, and any changes like `create`, `modify`, `delete` and `move` will change the file in Dropbox.\r\n\r\n### My PI ###\r\n\r\nI need to download some files in my PI, don't need to update or edit on PI. so I just need a cron running on watching.py -c.\r\n\r\nsoundbbg at gmail\r\n","google":"42721249","note":"Don't delete this file!
